# Auto-Grading System Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Test Failures with Same Solution
**Problem**: The same solution used to create the test kit was failing when graded against that test kit, with errors like "Content differs at position 61".

**Root Cause**: The `Normalize()` function in `DataComparisonService.cs` was joining all lines with spaces, destroying the line structure:
```
Before: "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
After (OLD BUG): "Line 1 Line 2 Line 3"  ← All newlines replaced with spaces!
After (FIXED): "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"  ← Newlines preserved ✓
```

**Fix**: Modified normalization to preserve newlines:
- Lines are now joined with `"\n"` instead of `" "`
- Only collapses multiple consecutive spaces on the same line
- Trims whitespace from each line individually
- Preserves the overall structure of multi-line output

**Impact**: Tests will now pass when comparing multi-line outputs like:
```
Client started, connecting to Server at http://localhost:5000/
Please enter integer number : 
```

### 2. Unwanted .txt Log Files
**Problem**: The system was creating debug .txt files in the `actual/servers/{question}/` directory.

**Location**: `MiddlewareProxyService.cs` was writing HTTP traffic to `.txt` files.

**Fix**: Removed file writing - HTTP traffic is now stored in memory only:
```csharp
// OLD (wrote to disk):
File.WriteAllText(path, sb.ToString(), Encoding.UTF8);

// NEW (memory only):
// Note: HTTP traffic is now stored in memory only (servers-req and servers-resp namespaces)
// This data is available for comparison steps and included in Excel output when tests fail
```

**Impact**: Cleaner output directories, no unnecessary debug files.

### 3. Enhanced Excel Output
**Problem**: User wanted test case detail Excel output with highlighted differences (green for expected, red for actual).

**Solution**: Enhanced `ExcelDetailLogService.cs`:
- Added `ExpectedOutput` column with **green** highlighting
- Added `ActualOutput` column with **red** highlighting  
- Both show full content (truncated at 5000 chars)
- Added `ExpectedExcerpt` and `ActualExcerpt` for quick comparison at the difference point
- Better context (20 chars around difference instead of 10)

**Visual Example**:
```
Column             | Content                          | Color
-------------------|----------------------------------|------------------
ExpectedOutput     | "Client started...\nPlease..."   | Green background
ActualOutput       | "Client started...\nEnter..."    | Red background
ExpectedExcerpt    | "...Please enter integer..."     | Green background
ActualExcerpt      | "...Enter integer number..."     | Red background
DiffIndex          | 61                               | (shows position)
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created and ran normalization tests:
```
✅ Test 1: Multi-line text preservation (case insensitive) - PASSED
✅ Test 2: Newlines are preserved - PASSED
✅ Test 3: Should NOT join lines with spaces (old bug) - PASSED
```

### Build Status
```
✅ Build succeeded
⚠️  8 warnings (null reference checks only, non-critical)
```

### Security Scan
```
✅ CodeQL: 0 vulnerabilities found
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Grading**: Solutions that created test kits now pass when graded against those test kits
2. **Clean Output**: No unnecessary .txt debug files
3. **Better Visualization**: Side-by-side comparison in Excel with color highlighting makes it easy to spot differences
4. **Detailed Context**: Both excerpt (for quick look) and full output (for detailed analysis) available

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. Existing test kits and configurations work as-is. The fixes are backward compatible.
