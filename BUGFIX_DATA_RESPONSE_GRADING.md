# Bug Fix: Data Response Grading Issue

## Problem
Data response validation was not working correctly when the expected JSON contained forward slashes (e.g., URLs, dates in format "YYYY/MM/DD").

### Symptoms
- When an expected JSON in the Excel DataResponse column contained forward slashes (like URLs: `http://example.com/api`), the grader would skip validation
- The test would show: `[Step] Result: PASS - Expected File Missing: Expected JSON missing (ignored)`
- Even when changing the actual server response data (e.g., changing book ID from 1 to 2), the test would still pass
- This meant data responses were not being validated at all when they contained certain characters

### Root Cause
The `TryReadContent` method in `DataComparisonService.cs` used a simple heuristic to detect if a string was a file path or inline content:

```csharp
// OLD CODE (buggy)
var looksLikePath = Path.IsPathRooted(path) || path.Contains('\\') || path.Contains('/');
if (!looksLikePath)
{
    content = path;
    return true;
}
return false;
```

This caused any string containing a forward slash to be treated as a file path. When the "file" didn't exist, the method returned `false`, causing the comparison to be skipped with an "Expected File Missing" message.

## Solution
Updated the `TryReadContent` method to properly detect inline JSON content:

```csharp
// NEW CODE (fixed)
// Check if this looks like inline JSON/CSV/text content rather than a file path
var trimmed = path.TrimStart();
if (trimmed.StartsWith("{") || trimmed.StartsWith("["))
{
    // This is inline JSON content
    content = path;
    return true;
}

// Only treat as path if it's rooted or contains backslashes (Windows paths)
// Forward slashes alone are not sufficient to identify a path (could be URLs, dates, etc.)
var looksLikePath = Path.IsPathRooted(path) || path.Contains('\\');
if (!looksLikePath)
{
    content = path;
    return true;
}
```

### Key Changes
1. **Explicit JSON detection**: If content starts with `{` or `[`, it's treated as inline JSON
2. **Improved path detection**: Forward slashes alone no longer indicate a file path
3. **Backward compatibility**: Windows paths with backslashes and rooted paths still work correctly

## Test Results
All edge cases now work correctly:

✅ **JSON with URLs**: `{"url": "http://example.com/api"}` - Now validated properly  
✅ **JSON with dates**: `{"date": "2024/11/01"}` - Now validated properly  
✅ **JSON arrays**: `[{"id": 1}, {"id": 2}]` - Works correctly  
✅ **Mismatch detection**: Different JSON values are properly detected as failures  
✅ **Simple JSON**: Backward compatibility maintained  
✅ **Plain text with slashes**: Still works for non-JSON comparisons  

## Impact
- Data response validation now works correctly for all JSON content, regardless of whether it contains forward slashes
- Students' submissions will now be properly validated against expected JSON responses
- Previously passing tests with incorrect data responses will now fail as expected
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
