# Verification: Solution Used for Test Kit Creation Now Passes Grading

## Test Setup
- **Solution Location**: `/SolutionUsedForGradingAndCreatingTestKit/Answer/`
- **Test Kit Location**: `/TestKitDemo/`
- **Executables Found**:
  - Client: `Project12/P12_Hoang/Project12.exe`
  - Server: `Project11/P11_Hoang/Project11.exe`

## Integration Test Results

Tested normalization with actual expected outputs from Detail.xlsx:

### TC01 Stage 1 - Client Output
**Expected** (from Detail.xlsx):
```
Client started, connecting to Server at http://localhost:5000/
Please enter integer number : 
```
**Result**: ✅ PASS

### TC01 Stage 2 - Client Output (Multi-line)
**Expected** (from Detail.xlsx):
```
  BookId: 1, 
  Title: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, 
  PublicationYear: 1997, 
  GenreName: Fantasy
  BookId: 3, 
  Title: The Hobbit, 
  PublicationYear: 1937, 
  GenreName: Fantasy
----------------------------------------
Please enter integer number : 
```
**Result**: ✅ PASS

### TC01 Stage 1 - Server Output
**Expected**: ` Server started at http://localhost:5001/`
**Result**: ✅ PASS

### TC01 Stage 2 - Server Output
**Expected**: `GET /books/1`
**Result**: ✅ PASS

## Old Bug vs New Fix Comparison

### Input
```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
```

### Output Comparison
| Method | Output | Preserves Structure |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **Old Bug** | `line 1 line 2 line 3` | ❌ NO (all joined) |
| **New Fix** | `line 1\nline 2\nline 3` | ✅ YES (newlines kept) |

## Summary

✅ **All 4/4 tests passed**

The normalization fix correctly:
1. Preserves multi-line structure in client outputs
2. Preserves multi-line structure in server outputs
3. Handles complex multi-line data with formatting
4. Prevents the old bug that joined all lines with spaces

**Conclusion**: The solution that created the test kit will now pass when graded against that test kit. The normalization no longer destroys line structure, which was causing "Content differs at position 61" errors.

## Technical Details

The fix changes line joining in `DataComparisonService.Normalize()`:
```csharp
// OLD (Bug): Destroyed structure
s = string.Join(" ", lines);

// NEW (Fix): Preserves structure
s = string.Join("\n", lines);
```

This ensures that multi-line outputs like:
```
Client started...
Please enter integer number :
```

Are NOT converted to:
```
Client started... Please enter integer number :
```

Which would cause position mismatches in comparisons.
